## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size - mainly desktop
- See the numbers go up or down when they click the respective buttons

### My Process

I replicated the basic markup of the Counter project and applied my own styles and logic to make it somewhat interactive. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned how to further establish my DOM manipulation learning, which I am still working on improving daily.

### Continued development

I will invest more time in JavaScript Project-related practice to understand the logic behind some JavaScript concepts applied here - including DOM Manipulation.


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - Excellent refresher for the basics.
